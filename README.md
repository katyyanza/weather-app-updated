## Instructions to create new repository locally

The following contain instructions to clone a new repository to your local machine:

1. Open terminal
2. Run `cd Desktop`
3. Run `cd GitHubtest`
4. Run `mkdir <my-repo-name>` but take out the `<>` and be sure to separate words with dashes (`-`)
   - Note you can also right click in the `GitHubtest` folder and click `New folder`
5. Run `cd <my-repo-name>`
6. Go to Github.com and click on the respository you want to clone locally
7. Copy the instructions under the "create a new repository on the command line" section
   - Note there are like 6 lines of code under this
8. Go back to the terminal, and paste and run those commands

Done! If you go back to Github.com to the new repo you wanted to clone, you will see it contains a `README.md` file and it is ready to be opened in VS Code.
